## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the `readme.md` with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples and the `readme.md` to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
